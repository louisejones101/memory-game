# User Experience (UX) 

<br>

## Initial Discussion

The Game consists of single home page with a tropical theme where the user tries to match pairs of identical tropical birds.  The aim of the game is to flip two cards over each turn and find the find the matching pairs of images.  

The game consists of a 16 card grid of made up of 4 x 4 tiles. There is a timer, a moves counter, a reset button, and a rules button.   The user will be able to read the rules before using the game if they wish by clicking on the rules button which will create a pop up containing the information.  

The game begins when the user clicks their first card choice which then triggers the timer to start.  The user will only be able to flip one card at a time and only two cards each turn.  If the cards match then they will stay visible on the screen, if not they are both flipped back over and they must click their next choice.  

Once all of the cards have been found the user will get a pop up congratulating them and letting them know how much time the game took them to complete and how many moves. They will have the option to play again and the game will reset.

<br>

## User Stories

### As a user

*   As a user I want to be able to see clearly on arriving at the site that it is a memory game, with a clear title and layout.  

*   I want to be able to see and understand the rules of the game before I play.

*   I want to be able to click two cards at a time and reveal the cards that I have clicked on.

*   I want the cards to stay revealed if they are a match and flip back over if not.

*   I want to be able to reset the game and the counter if I want to finish it early or start again.  

*   I want to be told when the game has finished. 

*   I want to be offered the opportunity to play again.  

<br>

## Design

The aim of this project was to build an interactive game that was fun, easy to operate and visually appealing. The game is able to be played by a user of any age.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme chosen were a vibrant coral, yellow, blues and greens.  The inspiration for the colour palette was taken from the background tropical image that I chose to use.  The colours chosen are bright and colourful. 

The title text, card backs, and buttons are the same colour to match the blue in the toucan.  The coral background of the game grid, was chosen to be similar to the toucans beak colour and matches the modal backgrounds to tie them all togther. The move counter text and the modal text are black so that they are able to be read easily against the coral background.  

The light yellow background was chosen to have a calming effect against the busy game colours and toucan image and help to distinguish between the game grid and the background.  
Below is a screenshot of the colours used.

<br>

### Typography

The fonts for this project were imported from Google Fonts, link in the [credit section](#credit-section).  The main font chosen was Merienda which I thought was quite a playful funky font.  For the Modal contents Calibri was used as there was quite alot of text and calibri is easier to read at small sizes than Merienda.  The back up text is San-serif. 

| Merienda font | Calibri |             
|--------|--------|
|<img src="assets/images/readmeimages/mainfont.png" width="500">|<img src="assets/images/readmeimages/modalcontentfont.png" >



<br>

### Imagery

The pictures used for his site were sourced from online websites that offer free images (these are listed in the [credit section](#credit-section). The bird images used for the face of the cards were on one sheet and had to be split down to smaller images.  The images were resized using Photoshop and Illustrator.

<br>

## Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were created by hand on the Ipad in Procreate.

## Page Features

The website consists of a main game page.  The game page contains the title of the game, the game grid, a background image, a rules button, a reset came button and a move counter.  When the user clicks on the rules button a modal pops up on screen and the user has to click the play Game button in the modal to close the window and begin the game.  

Once the user has successfully matched all the pairs of cards another modal pops up telling the user they have won the game. The user can then click the play again button to return to the game.  All of the cards are reset when the game has been succesfully completed. The cards are flipped back over, the counter is returned to 0 and the cards are shuffled to new positions. 

The cards have a coloured background and then are flipped over to reveal the image.  The buttons change colour when clicked to show that they have been activated.  The modal backgrounds are a slightly translucent black colour to partially hide the screen behind so as not to distracted from the message on the screen.

The site has a favicon as the website icon which was created using the coral and blue colours of the grid and the first letters of the Title.

## Accessibility

<br>

The font families and font size were chosen for their readability.

Colours for the backgrounds and the text where chosen to give as much contrast as possible for users to be able to see the text clearly. During testing using Wave it was highlighted that the images did not contain alt tags.  Discussed below in the testing section.


<br>



## Future Implementations

Future implementations - log in, record scores, have the modal tell your moves score.  Different levels more cards. A timer.

# Testing

Throughout the project I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to check the layout and responsiveness.  I regularly tried out the game and tested it features afer making changes.

## Accessibility Testing

In order to test the accessibility of the site I ran the pages through [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to see if there were any issues.

Below shows the some of the things it flagged during the test.  As you can see from the first screenshot below Wave flagged that the images used for the cards didn't have alt tags, the gameGrid was generated in JS using and array for the data but for some reason wave doesnt seem to pick them up.  I did not change anything.  

Bwlow is the screenshot showing the results with the img alt tags missing.ÃŸ

## Responsiveness

The table below contains responsiveness results for some of the standard devices in the Google Dev Tools options.

|Responsiveness|Iphone 8)|Samsung Galaxy S8 (360px)|Ipad Mini (768)|Surface Pro 7 (912px)|Galaxy Fold (280px)|Nest Hub (1024px)|Notes               |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
|Text scales down as expected|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|
|Columns align as designed|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|
|Game grid aligns correctly|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|
|Modals correct|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|


## Browser Compatibility

I tested all of the website pages in three different browsers to check that everything worked, the layout and appearance remained as it should.  The three browsers I chose were the three I had easy access to on my Apple Macbook, Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari.  Everything worked as it should in Chrome and Firefox however in Safari the navigation menu was left aligned on devices larger than tablet size rather than right aligned as intended.  I am not sure if this was due to Safari being an old version and not up to date. (The operating system on my mac doesnt allow for update).

|   |Google Chrome|Firefox|Safari|Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|------|------|
|intended appearance|Good|good|good|
|intended responsiveness|Good|Good|good|

<br>
<br>

## Features


For this section I manually tested every feature on every page to ensure all the links/buttons/form did as they should.  Below are the results.

## Lighthouse

As part of the testing I used Lighthouse in Google Chrome to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.  I tested both the desktop and the mobile version.  

Both the desktop and mobile versions had a good scores for best practice, performance and SEO.  The Accessibility score was in the lower 80's due to there not being an img alt tag on the background img for the cards.  The cards were in the CSS file so I could not add alt tags to them.  

Below are screenshots of the results from the lighthouse panel.

| Desktop | Mobile |
|------------------------|-----------------------|

</div>


## W3 Validator

To test the HTML code in the index.html I run the code through the W3 Validator.  It came back with an error stating that there was a section where a div could be.  So I changed the section to a div and re-run the code through a second time.  There were no errors returned.


| Before | After |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
|<img src="assets/readmeimages/">|<img src="assets/readmeimages/>|
</div>


## W3C Jigsaw

To check the CSS code I copied and pasted the code into the w3c css validator.  It highlighted one error with a 'unneccesary bg-image position - relative,' which I removed.  After the change had been made in the CSS file, the code was re-run through the validator and came back with no errors.

<br>

| CSS before | CSS after |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
|<img src="assets/readmeimages/">|<img src="assets/readmeimages/">|

</div>


## JSHint

To test the JS code I copied and pasted the code into JSHint.  It returned a few errors as you can see in the first image below.  Most of them were simple mistakes that could be changed.  All unnecessary semi-colons, and two unused variables were removed.  Missing semi-colons were added in.  

The remaining corrections it recommended were for 4 undefined variables.  These were the variables used to link to the HMTL document.  Due to time restraints I didnt have time to go back and take a look at them so they were left.  

It also suggested that there were some long functions in there, I did not change these, however for future projects I will used shorter functions.  The code was then run through JSHint again as you can see in the second image below.

## Code Used

YouTube tutorial by "DevelopedByEd' - Awesome Vanilla JavaScript Memory Card Game Tutorial"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tlb4tv4mC4 - I followed this tutorial to build the main grid of the game and the flip functions.  The main game container, grid and cards code was used and edited to fit what I wanted.  

W3 Schools - How to make a modal box with CSS.  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp  - I used some of the CSS styling from this example for my modal background to get the partly transparent overlay, I edited to suit my project.

## Images

The Bird images for the card faces were taken from this free download on freepik by macrovector. - 
 "https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/exotic-birds-set_3817867.htm#query=jungle%20birds&position=9&from_view=search&track=ais"


The background was made up from part of a tropical background image by BiZkettE1 which I downloaded from freepik.  The file was a psd file with layers so I was able to change the image around, delete and resize some of the features to suit what I wanted. - "https://www.freepik.com/free-psd/colorful-summer-nights-poster-template-with-toucan_4793703.htm#page=2&position=11&from_view=author"

The blue gradient background card image was created by myself in photoshop.
